THINGS THAT CHANGE DURING GAME:

	- character handle card -> receive from frontned card ID
		whole logic in JAVA
			add strenght, add health, remove strenght or remove health
			FIGHT - well later 
				frontend must know its fight and ...
				request to backend to check type -> if ENEMY CARD
					then request user to roll a dice - in JS generate random int (or in Java...)
					send random int to backend with a question who won
					backend calculates and sends who won
					frontend displays the result
