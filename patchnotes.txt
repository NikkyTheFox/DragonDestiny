BACKEND:
  PlayedGameRepository:
    - findPlayersByField() method to retrieve an OPTIONAL LIST of players on a given field
  PlayedGameService:
    - findCharactersInUse() method to retrieve an OPTIONAL LIST of characters used in given game
    - findPlayersByField() method to retrieve an OPTIONAL LIST of players on a given field
  PlayedGameController:
    - GET getCharactersInUse() request to retrieve a list of characters controlled by all players in game
    - GET getPlayersOnField() request to retrieve a list of players on a given field
    - GET checkPossibleNewPositions() request to retrieve FieldList to which a player can move to after a dice roll

  FRONTEND:

    NEW:
- pawn grid for each field showing only pawns that are on a given field
- summed up all stats that should be shown under character portrait (initial + received + cards)
- summed up all stats that should be shown in other-characters list (initial + received + cards)
- a player cannot join game that isStarted
- starting a game send startGame to backend
- dice roll from backend
- fields that player can move to are button based after a dice roll
- player's character can move to a chosen field

    IDEAS:
- check if all players have chosen a character before game starts moved from frontend to backend
- move getPossibleFields() from frontend to backend as a function that returns ids of fields a character can move to after rolling a dice
- prevent multiple dice rolls in backend
